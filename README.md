# LiteratureSimilarity
## Project description
This is python project that aims to measure statistical similarity between different texts of one author in order to build an author-recogniser (which would attribute texts into clusters).

## Potential
The results could provide a mechanism for detecting ghostwriters' usage. 

## Restrictions
This project is prose-based i.e. it is not fit for poems or drama.
